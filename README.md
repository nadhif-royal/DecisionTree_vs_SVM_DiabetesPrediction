# 🚀 Diabetes Prediction: Decision Tree vs SVM

This project aims to compare the performance of **Decision Tree** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** in predicting diabetes based on health-related features. The dataset used contains information such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.

## 📌 Dataset
The dataset consists of two parts:
- **Training Data**: Used to train both Decision Tree and SVM models.
- **Testing Data**: Used to evaluate the models' performance.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Before training the models, we performed **EDA** to understand the dataset, including:
- Data distribution analysis
- Feature correlation
- Handling missing values (if any)

## 🏆 Model Comparison
We implemented **Decision Tree** and **SVM** and compared their performance using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

### 🔥 Results:
| Model            | Accuracy | F1 Score | MSE  | R² Score |
|-----------------|----------|----------|------|---------|
| **SVM**        | 1.00     | 1.00     | 0.00 | 1.00    |
| **Decision Tree** | 0.80     | 0.80     | 0.20 | 0.17    |

## 📌 Key Findings
- **SVM performed better** in all evaluation metrics, achieving **100% accuracy**.
- **Decision Tree had lower performance**, with **80% accuracy** and a lower R² Score.
- The comparison highlights the **effectiveness of SVM** in handling this dataset.
